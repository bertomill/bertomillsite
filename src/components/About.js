    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I work with an incredible Enterprise Innovation team at CIBC, where we develop strategies around emerging technologies including artificial intelligence, blockchain, and quantum computing to create responsible and impactful business solutions to better serve our clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before joining CIBC, I studied at the Ivey School of Business and played on the Western University football team (2017-21).
    </p>
    <p>
      Away from work you'll find me reading, cycling, playing squash, or trying out a new cooking recipe (I love tacos).
    </p>
    <p>Send me a message and I'd love to chat!</p>
